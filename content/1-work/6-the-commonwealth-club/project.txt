Text: The Commonwealth Club of California is the nation's oldest and largest public affairs forum, and in September 2017, it opened its first permanent home at 110 The Embarcadero on San Francisco's waterfront. We had the opportunity to design the donor wall and donor recognition signage to mark this historic effort, celebrating all those who made The Commonwealth Club’s headquarters possible.

The discs identify giving levels through ascending heights while referencing the unique topography of San Francisco. The result is an installation that undulates, reflects, breathes, and provides a new perspective from every vantage point.
