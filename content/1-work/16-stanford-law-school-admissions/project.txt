Text: As a top-tier law school, Stanford Law School competes among peer schools of impressive strength. To express its unique identity and advantages, SLS sought to refresh its admissions collateral in both form and content.The goal: encourage students who would be a good fit with Stanford Law’s excellence-driven, innovative, collegial community to apply, and urge students who had been admitted to “say yes” to SLS.

Readmoretext: Choosing formats and styles that would authentically express Stanford Law’s identity and stand out in the law school landscape, we created three pieces: “Consider What Counts”—a two-sided card providing a numbers-driven, at-a-glance look at SLS distinctions; “Only at SLS”—a photo-driven roll-fold showcasing stand-out programs and opportunities; and “Yes”—the intimate stories (illustrated with pen-and-ink portraits) of nine alumni, students, and faculty who chose SLS as the law school that would shape their future.
