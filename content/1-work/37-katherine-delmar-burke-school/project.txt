Text: Founded in 1908, the Katherine Delmar Burke School—Burke’s to its friends—is an independent K-8 school for girls in San Francisco. In 2014 the school launched a four-year capital campaign—Many Voices. Many Hands. All Burke’s.—to support initiatives related to innovation, excellence, and community.

Readmoretext: Working within existing school guidelines, we created a visual identity for the campaign. Sun-filled and radiant, this logo tells a story about growth. The mark’s central focus is on All Burke’s, advancing the idea that everyone in the school community—girls, parents, alumnae, educators, supporters, friends—is essential to the school’s future. This theme, and the visual direction provided by the logo, informed the campaign case brochure and was extended to campaign stationery, note cards, and a folder.
