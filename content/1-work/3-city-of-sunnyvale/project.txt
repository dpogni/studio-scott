Text: Located in the heart of Silicon Valley, the City of Sunnyvale is a complex, dynamic organization with a rich history and deeply instilled pride.

It tells Sunnyvale's story and maintains its rich history—grounded by a strong, stable base, the top radiates with vitality reflective of its municipality and the diverse community it serves. The green color symbolizes strong attributes of Sunnyvale: balance, growth, energy, sustainability, parks and green space.
