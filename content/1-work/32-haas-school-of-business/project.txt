Text: UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business had just launched a new strategic plan centered around the unique culture that distinguishes Haas—with its connections to UC Berkeley—from other business schools. At the same time, the school sought to refresh its annual fund outreach materials to engage alumni more deeply.

Readmoretext: This pivotal moment for the school provided an opportunity to bring alumni together around the qualities that make Haas graduates stand out. Our theme was Always Berkeley. Always Haas. Only You.—an expression of solidarity around Berkeley-Haas values, with an emphasis on the role each graduate plays in perpetuating the school’s impact. Reminding alumni of the culture and the commitment they share, we created a suite of annual fund materials—brochure, facts brochure, leave behind, folder, remit device, invitations, note cards, buckslips — that carry the  “always/only” theme.
