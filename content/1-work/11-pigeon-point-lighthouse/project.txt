Title: Light Up the Future

Subheadline: The campaign to save Pigeon Point Lighthouse

Text: Built from 1871-1872 to ensure safe passage for ships along Central California's foggy, rocky coast, Pigeon Point Lighthouse is literally crumbling. Our task was to design an identity for the California State Parks Foundation's Campaign to Save Pigeon Point Lighthouse, aptly named Light Up the Future. Closed to the public since 2001, the campaign aimed to raise the necessary funds to save this remarkable 115-foot icon and reopen it to the world.

Readmoretext: The symbol was inspired by the down shot of the first-order Fresnel lens, comprised of 24 lens groupings identical to the existing hand-crafted lens. To visually support the campaign name, the symbol serves as a beacon, conveying radiance, positivity, and continuity. Brochures, exterior signage, and a donor wall were designed to give the campaign and its patrons visibility.
