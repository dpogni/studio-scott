Text: The Graduate Theological Union (GTU) is a consortium of eight private independent American theological schools and eleven centers and affiliates, and it is the most comprehensive center for the graduate study of religion in North America. We were engaged to create a new brand identity and visual system for the GTU that celebrated the union of differences, the quest for knowledge, and interreligious collaboration.

The structure of the skylight provided the perfect form to express convergence, and this became the inspiration for the new brand mark. The mark pushes both inward and outward in a dynamic and dimensional way. Whether it is associated with intersecting paths, journeys, energies, ideas, research, or solutions, the strength of the mark lies in its simple complexity.
