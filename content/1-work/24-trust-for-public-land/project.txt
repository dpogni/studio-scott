Text: Since 1972, The Trust for Public Land has worked to enrich cities with parks, playgrounds, trails, gardens, and open spaces for people to enjoy. In the quiet phase of its first national fundraising campaign, The Trust for Public Land wanted to reach potential donors with a case statement brochure that was both compelling and informative. The campaign theme—“The Power of Place”—provided a platform for showcasing the impact donors could have by supporting TPL’s mission: protecting places people care about, and creating close-to-home parks.
