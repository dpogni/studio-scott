Text: Located in the heart of Stanford's expanding art district, the Anderson Collection at Stanford University houses one of the world's most outstanding private assemblies of modern and contemporary American art. A new building was constructed to house the collection, and an identity and suite of materials were designed to mark its opening to the public in the fall of 2014.

Readmoretext: Inspired by the down view of the building, the symbol is quite literally the museum’s unique footprint on the Stanford campus and the world. The symbol reflects the discovery of art from both a visitor’s and artist’s perspective. Whether it is seen as a frame, screen, portal, or window, the negative space draws you in as if asking you to look at art in a new way.
