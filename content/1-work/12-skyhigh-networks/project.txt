Our solution captured Skyhigh’s multi-dimensionality with control and confidence—its frictionless, evolved platform, its focus on cloud security, its unparalleled intelligence. Known to symbolize clarity and wisdom, the diamond shape references the four directional points on a compass that directly correlate to cloud security, and when overlapped form an upward-reaching letter S. The gradient of color from light to darker blue nods to the gradiated blue tones in the sky from the ground, upward. There is movement, dimension and focus that says we are here—and we are everywhere in the cloud.

Skyhigh unveiled its new brand at its first livestreamed Cloud Security event on the future of cloud security on October 24, 2017.
