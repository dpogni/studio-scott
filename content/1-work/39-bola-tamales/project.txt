Text: De Alba Bakery—a three-generations-old Mexican family bakery in the Rio Grande Valley, Texas—approached us to help them create a brand identity and eCommerce packaging system for their popular line of traditional Mexican tamales. Aptly named “Bola Tamales” for the authentic, ball-like shape of their tamales, they wanted their new brand to provide a contemporary boldness and energy to the heritage of what started as a male, horseback-bound travel food tradition.

Inspired by the fusion of strength and artistry found in Mexican wrought iron, we created a round, radiant logo that—though inspired by traditions—is boldly and memorably modern. The color palette captures the natural richness found in traditional Mexican tiles, cut paper, ceramics and local Mexican food. The combination yields a visually active and vibrant branding system.
