Title: Light Up the Future

Subheadline: The Campaign to Save Pigeon Point Lighthouse

Text: Our brief was to design an identity for the California State Parks Foundation's Campaign to Save Pigeon Point Lighthouse, aptly named Light Up the Future. Built from 1871-1872 to ensure safe passage for ships along Central California's foggy, rocky coast, Pigeon Point Lighthouse is literally crumbling. Closed to the public since 2001, the campaign aims to raise the necessary funds to save this remarkable 115-foot icon and reopen it to the world. Brochures, exterior signage, and a donor wall were also part of this project.
