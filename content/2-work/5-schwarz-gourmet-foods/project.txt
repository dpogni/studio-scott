Title: Schwarz Gourmet Sausage

Subheadline: Celebrating 100 Years of European Favorites

Text: Family-owned for three generations and best known for its robust and award-winning sausage line of European favorites, Schwarzâ€™s existing packaging was getting lost in a very crowded sausage and frankfurter category. In celebration of its 100th anniversary,  the Schwarz brand and packaging system was redesigned to embrace its European heritage and recipes and capure the European/German design aesthetic in a retro/contemporary way. A restrained palette of red, black, cream, and white created a unified and visually strong shelf presence, and the simplifying the design elements enabled clear product focus on the crowded shelf. The 100th anniversary designation was integrated into a branded, celebratory banner, and this treatment was extended to shelf talkers, pricing tags, and deli counter signage.
