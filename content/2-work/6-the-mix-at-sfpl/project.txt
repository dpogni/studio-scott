The Mix at SFPL is an innovative, youth-designed, 21st century teen learning space that opened its doors in Summer 2015 in the San Francisco Public Library's Main branch. The nearly 5,000 square feet of space was outfitted with state-of-the-art digital media, video/sound recording, computer, and creative maker equipment to provide teens an amazing place to gain tech and literacy skills and expand their imaginations. The vibrant visual identity is comprised of six icons that come together in several configurations to represent the vibrant dynamism of learning, youth, and creative expression. An exclamation mark serves as a visual “you are here” reference, a place where things happen, while the icon bar showcases the breadth of The Mix’s resources including sound and video recording studios, a maker space, computer labs, study nooks, and a performance area. The resulting pictogram goes beyond words, language, and dialect to reach teens of all backgrounds and interests.
