Approach: The new mark reimagined the existing photo-realistic sequoia leaf silhouette as a contemporary symbol that leveraged Sequoia’s notworthty heritage while conveying the energy, strength, and guidance that Sequoia brings to a founder’s journey. The solidity and elongation of the wordmark’s letterforms reference the grounded mass and quiet height of a sequoia tree. The symbol—an abstracted sequoia leaf built on an 8x8 pixel grid—punctuates the wordmark with upward trajectory, motion, and vitality.

Results: The new mark informed Sequoia’s brand roll out (website, collateral, office interiors), was a catalyst for reenergized internal brand stewardship, and positioned Sequoia as a relevant, modern player in the youthful/tech-savvy VC space.
