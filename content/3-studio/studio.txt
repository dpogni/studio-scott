Founder: 

Laura Scott founded Studio Scott in 2009 to bring award-winning design and communications experience to a wide range of design disciplines: identity, branding systems, print, packaging, and environmental graphics. The studio works with clients of all sizes and specialties—from startups, non-profits, and small family businesses to Fortune 500 companies and educational and cultural institutions.

Prior to opening Studio Scott, Laura was an associate in the San Francisco office of Pentagram Design for 10 years. She has taught through Studio 5, the American Institute of Graphic Arts’ (AIGA) education outreach program for inner city fifth graders, has been a guest instructor at the Academy of Art University, and is currently the education chair on AIGA San Francisco’s board of directors.

Before becoming a graphic designer, Laura served as communications director and congressional liaison for a non-profit education association in Washington, DC. Laura received her BA in English and Art History from Colby College and her MFA in Graphic Design with valedictorian distinction from the Academy of Art University.
